# Simple_Server
Utility that could be used to create a simple HTTP(s) server that logs incoming requests for testing purposes (es., Clickjacking, Malware endpoint communication, etc..)

Note. This project aims to help myself with my daily tasks. Because of that, updates and support will be provided when needed.


## Updates
2022/06/10 Server supports forwarding capability. More precisely, it's now possible through the switch `-f` to specify an endpoint to forwards **incoming POST request**
